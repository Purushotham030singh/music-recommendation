# Personalized Music Recommendation System

This repository showcases the development of a **Personalized Music Recommendation System** using a publicly available Spotify dataset from Kaggle. The system employs advanced Machine Learning techniques to curate song suggestions tailored to individual user preferences.

## Project Overview

The system analyzes a user's listening habits and uses music metadata to suggest songs they are likely to enjoy. Built on the Spotify dataset, the project leverages features like **acousticness**, **danceability**, **energy**, **tempo**, **valence**, and others to fine-tune recommendations.

## Key Goals

The project's goals include:

1. **Tailored User Experiences**  
   Deliver personalized song suggestions aligned with users' unique tastes.

2. **Data-Driven Insights**  
   Utilize music features effectively for enhanced recommendation accuracy.

3. **High-Performance Models**  
   Build ML models prioritizing precision, recall, and overall system reliability.

4. **Scalable Architecture**  
   Ensure seamless performance as the dataset and user base grow.

5. **Enhanced Engagement**  
   Promote sustained user interaction by offering relevant music recommendations.

6. **Algorithm Experimentation**  
   Test multiple recommendation algorithms to find optimal solutions for this use case.

7. **Behavioral Analysis**  
   Explore user preferences and song popularity patterns for informed system improvements.

8. **Adaptive Learning**  
   Implement mechanisms for the system to evolve with additional user data over time.

## Approach

The development process includes:  

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw data for machine learning.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and optimizing key attributes for accurate predictions.  
- **Model Training:** Experimenting with algorithms like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.  
- **Evaluation:** Testing model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
